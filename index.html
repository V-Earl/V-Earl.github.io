My name is Valerie Earl and I am currently an AML/ Compliance Analyst, soon to be Full Stack Web Developer. Although it has been challenging learning something completely different, I am enjoying the process of really stretching and pushing myself. So far, it has been an interesting ride but I am here to enjoy the journey and learn as much as I can.

<br>
               
A few things that I enjoy in life are traveling and learning about other cultures, trying new foods, spending time with the people I love and hearing my daughter laugh. These days, I am just taking life as it comes  and living by the motto that if it is to be, it will be.
